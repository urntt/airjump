# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents working in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` imports this file, so keep all agent guidance here.

## Project

`airjump` is a client-side [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod for Minecraft: Java Edition that lets the local player jump in mid-air.

The air jump behavior comes from the archived [urntt/nojumpdelay-legacy](https://github.com/urntt/nojumpdelay-legacy), which bundled it with the jump cooldown removal; the cooldown removal now lives in [urntt/nojumpdelay](https://github.com/urntt/nojumpdelay). The legacy repository may be consulted for its air jump behavior. Do not copy its build configuration, which predates the current Fabric template, or its package layout.

## Project decisions

These decisions are settled. Do not deviate from them without the user's explicit approval.

### Minecraft and toolchain

- Development started on Minecraft 26.3 with Java 25. `gradle.properties` is the single source of truth for the mod, Minecraft, Fabric Loader, Loom, Fabric API, and Java versions. `build.gradle`, `fabric.mod.json`, the mixin config, and the CI workflows read them from there; do not restate them elsewhere.
- Follow the latest official Fabric template ([FabricMC/fabric-example-mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod), also available from the [template generator](https://fabricmc.net/develop/template/)): the `net.fabricmc.fabric-loom` Gradle plugin, Mojang's official names with no `mappings` dependency, and `implementation` (not `modImplementation`) for dependencies. Do not use Yarn.
- Pin `loom_version` to a release version instead of the template's `-SNAPSHOT`, so builds are reproducible.
- Target only the latest stable (release) Minecraft version. Updates, fixes, and new features are always developed against it. Snapshots, pre-releases, and release candidates are not supported targets.
- Do not maintain older Minecraft versions and do not set up multi-version builds (no per-version branches, no Stonecutter or other preprocessors). When a new stable version is released, port the mod to it and drop the previous one.

### Identity

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Mod ID | `airjump` |
| Display name | `airjump` |
| Maven group | `com.urntt` |
| Base package | `com.urntt.airjump` |
| Version format | `<SemVer>+<Minecraft version>`, for example `1.0.0+26.3` |
| License | MIT |

The mod version itself follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); the `+<Minecraft version>` suffix is build metadata naming the Minecraft version the build targets. Version numbers start at `1.0.0`.

### Distribution

- Releases are published only as GitHub Releases. Do not publish to Modrinth, CurseForge, or any other mod platform, and do not add publishing tooling for them.
- `README.md` must clearly warn that this is a movement modification: it may conflict with server anti-cheat systems, and using it in multiplayer may get the player set back, kicked, or banned.

### Scope and behavior

- Client-only: `fabric.mod.json` declares `"environment": "client"`. There is no server-side component and no networking.
- The mod only adds air jumps. Other movement features are out of scope; in particular, removing the jump cooldown belongs to nojumpdelay, and the mod must not change fall damage or add flight.
- Only the local player (`LocalPlayer`) is affected. Every other entity, including other players and mobs simulated on the client, stays vanilla.
- The behavior follows the legacy mod: while the **Air Jump Modifier** key (default `R`) is held, each new press of the jump key while the player is in mid-air performs one vanilla jump (`LivingEntity.jumpFromGround()`), so jump boost and sprint jumping work as usual. The number of air jumps is unlimited. Holding the jump key does not repeat air jumps, and presses made while a screen is open do not count.
- Air jumps only happen in mid-air. They do not happen on the ground (vanilla jumps there), in water or lava, while climbing, while flying, while gliding with an elytra, or while riding.
- There is no toggle key and no configuration file. Holding the modifier key is the only control, and unbinding it disables air jumps. Vanilla saves the key binding in `options.txt`.

### Localization

- All user-facing text, including key binding names and the key binding category, uses translation keys. Never hard-code display strings.
- Provide translations for `en_us` and `zh_cn`, and keep both complete whenever a translation key is added or changed.

### Dependencies

- Required: Fabric Loader and Fabric API.
- Do not add other dependencies without the user's explicit approval.

### Implementation

- Language: Java only.
- Source sets: `src/main` holds only `fabric.mod.json` and the icon. All code and client resources live in `src/client`, and the client game tests live in `src/gametest`.
- Prefer Fabric API events over mixins. If a mixin becomes necessary, prefer the MixinExtras injectors bundled with Fabric Loader (for example `@ModifyExpressionValue` and `@WrapOperation`) over `@Redirect` and `@Overwrite`, to stay compatible with other mods and keep porting work small.

### Testing

- The client game tests in `src/gametest` start Minecraft and check the air jump behavior. Keep them passing and extend them when behavior changes.
- After porting to a new Minecraft version, run the client game tests. A successful build does not prove that the mod still has the intended effect.
- `README.md` describes how to run them, including on a headless machine.

### CI, releases, and changelog

- GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) builds the project and runs the client game tests on every push and pull request.
- Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Record every user-visible change under `Unreleased` in the same change that introduces it.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the mod and publishes a GitHub Release for the project version, with the jar attached and the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section as release notes. It runs when a tag `v<version>` (for example `v1.0.0+26.3`) is pushed, or when started manually on a branch, in which case it creates that tag on the branch's latest commit. It fails if a pushed tag does not match the project version, if the changelog has no section for the version, or if the release already exists.
- Release only when the user asks. To release, set `mod_version` in `gradle.properties`, rename `Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md` to `[<version>] - <YYYY-MM-DD>` above a new empty `Unreleased` section, commit, and push. Then start the release workflow on `main`. Claude Code cloud sessions cannot push tags, so start the workflow through the GitHub Actions API instead.

## Engineering principles

- Fix root causes, not symptoms. Diagnose the underlying cause before implementing a permanent fix. If an immediate mitigation is necessary, treat it as temporary and follow through with a root-cause fix.
- Prefer configuration-driven design for values that are expected to vary by environment, deployment, or product requirements. Avoid unexplained or duplicated magic values, but do not introduce configuration where a well-named constant is the clearer source of truth.
- Preserve a single source of truth and clear ownership for data, state, configuration, business logic, and authoritative documentation. Avoid duplicating canonical information across multiple locations.
- Do not maintain parallel legacy and replacement implementations without an explicit migration and removal plan.

## Documentation

- Keep documentation aligned with the code. When a code change affects documented behavior, APIs, architecture, configuration, workflows, or usage, update the relevant documentation in the same change.
- Keep each document's responsibility clear. For example, use `README.md` for project overview and usage, and `VISION.md` for product direction, architectural principles, or long-term decisions.
- Always specify a language identifier for fenced code blocks in Markdown.

## Language

- Communicate with the user in Chinese, including explanations, progress updates, and user-facing planning.
- Use English for development artifacts, including source code, comments, docstrings, documentation, READMEs, Git branch names, commit messages, and other deliverables intended to live in the repository.

## Git

- Do not change or override the Git author or committer identity. When an identity must be configured for commits created during the task, use:
  - Name: `urntt`
  - Email: `urntts@gmail.com`
- Do all actions on the user's behalf. Do not rewrite existing commit authorship unless explicitly requested. Do not add `Co-Authored-By` trailers or session links to commit messages or pull request descriptions.
- Develop on `main` and push directly to it. Branches and pull requests are not required.
- Because changes land on `main` without review, make sure `./gradlew build` and the client game tests pass locally before pushing.
- If a branch is used, give it a category-based prefix that reflects the purpose of the change, such as `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `test/`, or `chore/`.
- Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages.
